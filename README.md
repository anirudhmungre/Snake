## Software Process and Technologies

The software process used was agile with intermittent white box and static analysis done throughout the development process as to ensure flexibility with changing requirements. More vigourous unit testing near the end of the development process.  
Technologies chosen were p5 for graphics in JavaScript as well as MochaJS for testing suite and Chai for assertions. This combonations of technologies allowed for an overall coverage of the development process.
